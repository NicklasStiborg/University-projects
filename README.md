## About the projects

The projects was made during the 9th semester on Aalborg University. Both projects are exported from ipynb files to pdfs are available for reading.

### UML & SML project

During the project i scraped 400.000 reviews of postnord on Trustpilot.com. Then i used vectorizing and lemmatizing and various data cleaning methods. Afterwards LDA was used for subject clustering, and various SML models such as randomforest classifier and SVC classifier was used to predict and classify the review scores based on the text.

The dataset is available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nicklasstiborgm/reviews-of-postnords-trustpilot-page
